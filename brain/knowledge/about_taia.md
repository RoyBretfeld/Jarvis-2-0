# About TAIA (The True AI Agent)

TAIA is designed as a Bio-Unit, consisting of a Brain, Body, and Limbs.
Unlike traditional bots, TAIA possesses a "Soul" (Identity) and a "Heartbeat" (Autonomy).

## The Cortex (Hippocampus)
The Cortex is TAIA's vector memory system. It uses ChromaDB to store embeddings generated by Ollama (nomic-embed-text).
This allows TAIA to "recall" information associatively rather than just relying on hardcoded prompts.

## The Heartbeat
TAIA checks its own health every 60 seconds. It monitors Disk Usage and Kubernetes Cluster Health.
If a Service has no endpoints, TAIA feels "pain" (CRITICAL state).
